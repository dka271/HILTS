HILTS: Hearing Impaired Learning Transcript System
Authors: Daniel Amick, Thanh Pham, Peter Tsongalis

The goal of HILTS is to provide a unique experience for hearing impaired students by allowing participation in courses with no accommodations for these students at low cost.
HILTS accomplishes this by providing a transcript of the course from the teacher to the student while allowing students to post questions to the teacher via a GUI.

Student GUI:
	
	Must be run using Python 3.4.x on a Raspberry Pi that is connected 
	to the same network as the teacher's Raspberry Pi.
	
	Once started, the student must type in the IP address of the teacher's 
	Raspberry Pi and press connect to begin receiving the class transcript.
	
	To send a question to the teacher, the student must type a question into 
	the appropriate box and press the send question button.
	
	
Teacher GUI:

	Must be run using Python 3.4.x on a Raspberry Pi with Google Speech API,
	microphone, RabbitMQ, and GPIO capabilities. 
	
	Once started, the teacher can choose a language to begin a transcript in and
	can then choose to start the transcript. Once the transcript has begun, the teacher
	wears the microphone and gives the lecture which is transcripted and sent to all
	of the connected student's Raspberry Pi's. 
	
	Overhead involved in setting up the teacher's Raspberry Pi can be resolved by 
	visiting the following documentation sites:
	
		Google Cloud Speech API: https://cloud.google.com/speech/docs/
		RabbitMQ Server Setup: https://www.rabbitmq.com/
